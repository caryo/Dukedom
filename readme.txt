# Hammurabi by Rick Merrill and David Ahl (1969) is the
# original computerized land management game.  It was
# expanded by Lee Schneider and Todd Voros as Kingdom (1974)
# and then by Vince Talbot as Dukedom (1976).  It was further
# revised by Jamie Hanrahan and finally converted to Microsoft
# Basic by Richard Kaapke.  This final version first appeared
# in Creative Computing, February 1980
